\title{An external location is an object that combines a cloud storage path with a
storage credential that authorizes access to the cloud storage path. Each
external location is subject to Unity Catalog access-control policies that
control which users and groups can access the credential. If a user does not
have access to an external location in Unity Catalog, the request fails and
Unity Catalog does not attempt to authenticate to your cloud tenant on the
userâ€™s behalf.}
