\description{
This is a long-running operation, which blocks until Serving Endpoints on Databricks reach
NOT_UPDATING state with the timeout of 20 minutes, that you can change via \code{timeout} parameter.
By default, the state of Databricks Serving Endpoints is reported to console. You can change this behavior
by changing the \code{callback} parameter.
