\description{
Databricks recommends using SCIM provisioning to sync users and groups
automatically from your identity provider to your Databricks workspace. SCIM
streamlines onboarding a new employee or team by using your identity provider
to create users and groups in Databricks workspace and give them the proper
level of access. When a user leaves your organization or no longer needs
access to Databricks workspace, admins can terminate the user in your
identity provider and that userâ€™s account will also be removed from
Databricks workspace. This ensures a consistent offboarding process and
prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data.
